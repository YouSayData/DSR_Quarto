## R Markdown

R Markdown is a tool for integrating prose, code, and results for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

1. For communicating to decision makers.

2. For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!).

3. As a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.

### How it works

It contains three important types of content:

- (optional) YAML header
- chunks of R code
- text mixed with simple text formatting

### Example

```{r include = FALSE}
library(viridis)
```

The code below demonstrates two color palettes in the [viridis](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis) package. Each plot displays a contour map of the Maunga Whau volcano in Auckland, New Zealand.

#### Viridis colors

```{r}
image(volcano, col = viridis(200))
```

#### Magma colors

```{r}
image(volcano, col = viridis(200, option = "A"))
```

## Exercises

1. Practice what youâ€™ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold.
